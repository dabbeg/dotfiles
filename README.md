# David's Dotfiles
This repository contains all important dotfiles that I keep track of and a handy way of keeping track of them from multiple computers.

## Install
Clone the repository and run the install script:

`./install.sh`

## How to manage what dotfiles are used
Simply open the 'install/link.sh' script and add the filename in the appropriate file list.
